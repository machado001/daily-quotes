POC made in order to get started with the concepts learned from the [Android Essentials Course](https://pl-coding.com/android-essentials).

In progress.

The main goal of this POC is to learn Gradle multi-modular projects, using build-logic and convention plugins, following clean architecture principles and applying the new Gemini Api to generate some texts (not implemented yet).
